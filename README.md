A small app that records audio and can be triggered in various ways.

It was one of my first apps, i gave it a small rewrite and decided to make it open source.

It's also published under https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.thedarken.audiobug

I would like to publish more open source software and had to start somewhere :).
